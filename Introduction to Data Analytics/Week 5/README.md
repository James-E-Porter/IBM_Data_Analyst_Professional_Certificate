* Analytics-enabled job roles - These roles include jobs where having analytic skills can up-level your performance and differentiate you from your peers.

* Other Data Professions - There are several other roles in a modern data ecosystem, such as Data Engineer, Big Data Engineer, Data Scientist, Business Analyst, or Business Intelligence Analyst. If you upskill yourself based on the required skills, you can transition into these roles. 

There are several paths you can consider in order to gain entry into the Data Analyst field. These include:

* An academic degree in Data Analytics or disciplines such as Statistics and Computer Science.

* Online multi-course specializations offered by learning platforms such as Coursera, edX, and Udacity.
